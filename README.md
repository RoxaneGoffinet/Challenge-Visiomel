# Challenge-Visiomel
 
Project in a team of 4 aimed at predicting cancer relaspe from skin fragments. Dataset given through the Visiomel competition, based on real whole slice images. Code is private but our paper can be found on this repo. More details in the paper. In short:

Self-supervised learning to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled instances through SimCLR, DinoV2 and ByOL.

Multi-instance learning + attention module to predict at the whole slice level the relapse probability of patients and interpret predictions.

Unofficially beat best metrics from the competition - not considering all practical problems
